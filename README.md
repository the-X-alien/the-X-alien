Hi, I'm a soon to be 13 yr old named Dhiaan Dave! I live the great and glorius state of California. I'll be an 8th grader at Thomas Russell Middle during the 2025-2026 school year.

I have a bunch of CLI python knowledge and now I am trying to learn JavaScript and with it stuff like React.js and Next.js
I'm always open to suggestions be it about Github, coding, hardware, or just learning anything in general
You can catch me at dhiaandave@outlook.com
(He/Him/His)
Thats about it for now!
