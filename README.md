Hi, I'm Dhiaan Dave! I live the great and glorius state of California. I'm a student at Thomas Russell Middle School.

I have a bunch of CLI python knowledge and now I am trying to learn JavaScript and with it stuff like React.js and Next.js
I'm always open to suggestions be it about Github, coding, hardware, or just learning anything in general
(He/Him/His)
Thats about it for now!
